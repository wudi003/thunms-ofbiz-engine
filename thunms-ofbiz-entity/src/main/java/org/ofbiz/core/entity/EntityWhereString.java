/**
 * <p>Encapsulates SQL expressions used for where clause snippets.
 * NOTE: This is UNSAFE and BREAKS the idea behind the Entity Engine where
 * you avoid directly specifying SQL. So, KEEP IT MINIMAL and preferrably replace
 * it when the feature you are getting at is implemented in a more automatic way for you.</p>
 *
 * <p>By minimal I mean use this in conjunction with other EntityConditions like the
 * EntityExpr, EntityExprList and EntityFieldMap objects which more cleanly
 * encapsulate where conditions and don't require you to directly write SQL.</p>
